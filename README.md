This program displays a simple menu where the user can choose between adding an item, viewing items, opening the settings menu, or exiting. 
It uses if-statements to check which option the user selects, and inside the settings option it includes another nested menu that lets the user turn notifications on or off. 
The program prints a message based on the user’s choice and shows how nested if-statements can be used to handle multiple levels of input.




part-2
This program asks the user to enter three numbers and then uses nested if-statements to figure out which one is the largest. It compares the numbers step by step until it finds the 
biggest value and prints it out to the screen.The goal of the program is to practice basic conditional logic and how nested if-structures work in C++.
